## Building an API is hard
Structure REST api url is difficult especially with `readability` and `efficiency`


### What's an API?
- At its core, an API is a contract, saying:
- Send me this REQUEST (client)
- I'll send you this RESPONSE(server)
- It's all about the data
- The rest, we'll leave to the gRPC framework


### What's gRPC
- gRPC is a free and open-source framework developed by google
- gRPC is part of clud native computation foundation (CNCF) - like Docker & Kubernetes for example
- At a high level, it allow syou to define REQUEST and RESPONSE for RPC(Remote Procedure Calls) and handles all the rest for you
- On top of it, it's modern, fast and efficient, build on top of HTTP/2, low latency, supports streaming, langguage independent, and makes it super easy to plug in authentication, load balancing, logging and monitoring
